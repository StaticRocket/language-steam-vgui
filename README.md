# Language-Steam-VGUI
### Steam VGUI language support in Atom

This is a language package for the open source text editor Atom.
It is loosely based off of the [Notepad++ UDL](https://gist.github.com/nairdan2/b164c8e63c5823c86414) that Steam lists on their developer [Wiki page for VGUI Editing](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/VGUI_Editing#Helpful_Tools) and it's more recent [fork](https://gist.github.com/Efreak/8ca24046da8521b43a99), with some modifications by yours truly.

This is my first package so any contributions/critiques are welcome.

Any useful user derived snippets are welcome. I didn't populate them myself for fear of overdoing it. See the Atom Flight Manual page on [snippets](https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/snippets/) for more information.
